Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.",4.3,"Brightidea

Next Insurance is a fast-growing 300+ person startup based in Silicon Valley and is led by a team of experienced entrepreneurs with a history of successful outcomes. Our mission is to transform insurance for small businesses by combining world-class technology and phenomenal customer service to offer better insurance at a lower price. Next has raised over $380 million from top tier investors and is the valley’s latest unicorn, valued at over $1 billion.

Next is well-positioned to become the leader in the $140 billion small business insurance market because we offer a 100% online experience that is tailored to unique business needs and we get customers insured in minutes – something no one else does. Despite the size of the market, the experience of buying small business insurance has not caught up with best practices instituted in other industries like banking, lending, and even personal lines insurance. There is still a lot of paper involved, purchasing a policy can take days or even weeks, and the coverage is so complex that it’s hard for entrepreneurs to understand what they are buying. We’re here to change that. Our goal is to make insurance simple, affordable, and transparent for small businesses so they can stop worrying about insurance and focus on running their businesses.

We are looking for a driven Data Scientist to help us bring machine learning to the insurance industry. As a data scientist at Next Insurance, you will work on a wide range of projects, including building predictive risk models, fine-tuning user experience, and optimizing internal operations. You will enable us to make the best use of our proprietary data, supplemented with novel data sources which you get to assemble creatively.

You’ll also have day-to-day exposure to multiple members of the company leadership team and will be joining a small, nimble team of 5+ scientists, with lots of room for growth and impact.

Responsibilities:


Research and develop predictive models (we typically start with a POC and then work with Product and Engineering counterparts to transition to production)

Iterate and pivot quickly to deliver MVP solutions. Design quick experiments to maximize learning

Understand the data and dig deep to extract actionable insights

Think creatively and outside the box to answer desired experimental questions

Work cross-functionally with engineering, product, marketing, business intelligence, insurance operations, customer support, senior management, and external partners

Desired Skills and Experience:


2-4 years of hands-on experience in data mining, machine learning and/or statistical analysis

BS/MS in Computer Science, Statistics, Applied Math, or related areas

Experience in writing both agile exploratory analyses as well as production-level code in a fast-paced environment

Ability to communicate the results of analyses clearly and effectively

Fluency with an analytical programming language (APL) (preferably Python) and the standard numerical packages

Fluency with data extraction/manipulation tools (preferably SQL & Pandas)

One of our core values is ‘Play as a Team’; this means making sure everyone has an equal chance to participate and make a difference. We win by playing together. Next Insurance is an equal opportunity employer and prioritizes building a diverse and inclusive workplace. We provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants of any type and do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, genetic information or characteristic, gender identity and expression, veteran status, or other non-job-related characteristics or other prohibited grounds specified in applicable federal, state, and local laws.

Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks has developed an innovative new way to deliver ultra high speed internet to suburban neighborhoods using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

Role

As our first Data Scientist, you will own our entire data pipeline, from instrumentation and extraction to analytical presentations to the executive team. Building Internet infrastructure is expensive and our business model relies on leveraging data to find as many efficiencies as possible. To that end, you’ll work with Product to find creative ways to reduce hardware costs, with Growth to squeeze every last conversion out of our onboarding funnel, with Engineering to discern network-wide ramifications of minute changes to router kernel parameters, with Coverage to sketch out the best buildings to target when we launch new markets, and with Operations to identify process breaks before they show up in our top-level metrics.

The ideal candidate is passionate about democratizing our data and eager to wear many hats -- one day might entail installing Tableau and coaching stakeholders on best practices with the new BI tool, while another might involve changing our backend to emit that one metric that’s going to drastically simplify the analysis you’re trying to run. Our entire stack runs on GCP, with BigQuery as our data warehouse and all of our backend written in golang on Google’s Appengine -- bonus points if you come in with experience in those technologies, but we’d also be thrilled to invest in a great candidate that hasn’t worked with those exact products.

What you do
Build and maintain dashboards for core operational metrics (e.g. network reliability, growth funnel)
Own the methodologies behind how we measure ourselves and create new metrics as the business evolves
Clean and organize our data warehouse, manage scheduled aggregations, and expose rich views of data to stakeholders
Run your own investigations into our trickiest problems, finding approachable ways to present and visualize your findings to the rest of the company
Implement simple changes to our codebase when necessary -- you don’t let yourself get blocked on engineering
Chart out Common’s data roadmap, striking the right balance between quick-and-dirty analysis vs. building out robust, scalable data flows.
Requirements
BS with 5+ years of professional experience in a Data Scientist or Data Analyst role
Solid programming skills in at least one language in addition to excellent SQL skills
Experience working with and manipulating large, complex datasets. Experience solving non-routine analysis problems, choosing the appropriate analytical methods and carrying the entire analysis from initial data gathering and requirements specification to final reporting and stakeholder presentation
Experience building, managing and organizing ETLs and data pipelines
Experience working with stakeholders to produce golden data datasets and clear views of common data needs
Excited to work in a startup environment on a small team; creative, resourceful, comfortable in a fast-moving environment. Excited to take on a wide range of responsibilities and cover many different roles loosely aligned around Data.

166,Data Scientist,-1,"Watchful is a platform that makes machine teaching easy, scalable, and automated. The biggest blocker to delivering ML models in production is no longer the algorithms, but the data (or lack thereof) to train the models. Currently, this has been solved by scaling-out human annotators or labelers and there are a number of managed services that have risen to meet this need. However, for use cases that require specific context (intelligence, legal, cyber, etc.) and/or is based on sensitive or classified data, these solutions are untenable.

Watchful is a disruptive automated annotation platform that puts the power back in the hands of data scientists and subject matter experts to label orders of magnitude more data, in orders of magnitude less time.

287,Data Scientist - Computer Vision,-1,"Sentinel's Mission is to Protect Democracies Against the Threats of Deepfakes & Information Warfare

Trusted and truthful information is the blood flow of democracy as informed citizens decisions depend on it. At the same time adversarial nations and organizations conduct disinformation campaigns and information operations to influence the information and decisions citizens make, also known as psychological operations. This has led to genocides in Myanmar, burning of 5G masts in the UK, a trend of anti-vaccination, climate change denial and all the way up to influencing the democratic processes in the examples of the U.S. 2016 presidential elections and the Brexit. Information warfare affects every single one of us and is one of the biggest challenges democracies face today.

We work with democratic governments, international media and defence agencies to help protect democracies and citizens from disinformation campaigns, synthetic media and information operations by developing a state-of-the-art AI detection platform. We enable to make better, more informed decisions in life-and-death situations. Our vision is to become the trust layer for the Internet by verifying the entire critical information supply chain and safeguard 1 billion citizens from information warfare.

The company was founded by ex-NATO AI and cybersecurity experts. We're based in Tallinn, Estonia, funded by world-class investors such as Jaan Tallinn (Co-Founder of Skype, early investor of DeepMind) and Taavet Hinrikus (Co-Founder of TransferWise). We won't tell you that you're making the world a better place with ad optimization and emoji filters. But if you are passionate about protecting democracy and solving some of the world's hardest challenges that have real impact, come join Sentinel and build the trust layer of the Internet.

Your Opportunity & Role

As a computer vision data scientist your mission and responsibility is to architect, develop and ship the world’s leading platform for monitoring, analyzing, detecting and countering deepfakes and synthetic media at web scale.

We believe that user-centric design and customer obsessions ultimately leads to the best product, so we listen closely to our users, both external and internal. This means you'll be an active voice in shaping our product and together with the team solving the most difficult challenges our customers face. You will be proposing high-level architectures and then implementing them end-to-end all the way from understanding the customer need, getting the data, building data pipelines, training the models, shipping them into production, optimizing inference and monitoring the product usage. As importantly, you will play a crucial role in growing and scaling the company in all areas because you know your decisions and execution will move the early-stage startup to the next stage.

The technical challenges you face are at self-driving car level hard, so you will be constantly pushing the boundaries what is possible. You will be working wide range of tasks with web scale video data such as face recognition, face clustering, image and video classification, detecting physiological signals, adversarial ML, data augmentation, explainability, ensembles, fusion, etc. Thus you will be automating tasks all over the spectrum from experimenting with cutting-edge CV challenges and pushing state-of-the-art research (i.e. deepfake detection) to quickly deploying well-solved ones (i.e. face recognition).

Your Impact

We move extremely fast and you will have an immediate impact after completing the onboarding week. You will dive right into our product, customers, technology and shipping the first product feature to production the next week. After that, you will own a major feature area of the platform and will be responsible for it end-to-end. Growingly, you will architect, develop and ship the world’s leading platform for monitoring, analyzing, detecting and countering information warfare campaigns at web scale. Your actions will lead to protecting millions of people lives and through that your work will be measured.

You will be attending some of our customer calls to understand their problems and needs. Participate in interviewing and hiring, as a way to influence team growth and how our values inform our culture. Depending on your skills, ambition and self-development you have the opportunity to grow into team lead or other meaningful roles. We want you to have a lasting impact in our company, customers, product and mission as one of the early employees who made our success story possible.

The User Support Analysis (USA) group performs custom analyses for research projects across the JGI. These include diverse experiment types (including resequencing, transcriptomics, epigenomics, single cell transcriptomics, nanopore sequencing, metabolomics, CRIPSR screens), and subject areas (plant, fungal, microbial and environmental genomics projects). Our group contributes to hundreds of projects from JGI’s user programs each year, and also provides substantial input on internal proof of principle projects using new technologies. Some recent examples include: population genomics in poplar (Nature genetics 46 (10), 1089-1096), functional genomics in bacteria (Nature 557 (7706), 503-509), single-cell transcriptomics in plants (Cell reports 27 (7), 2241-2247. e4).

The new Data Scientist will act as project lead within the USA group to implement custom analyses in support of new genomic technologies, and develop automated pipelines as projects scale. Work will be in one to two main subject areas, with a likely focus on resequencing analysis and epigenomics (though new technologies may take precedence).

Every year, while Americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don't accept that.

Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we're working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.

We are growing extremely quickly, working on a problem that is fundamental, sitting at the crossroads between the workforce and employers. Ten years from now, it'll look silly to use anything other than Triplebyte for technical hiring.
Company Culture
We have a laid-back, friendly office culture. Over lunch you'll often find us discussing the latest in technology, books, and pop culture, and then maybe getting in a quick game of chess or babyfoot (foosball).
Since we're an early-stage company, we move fast, and it's important that each member of our team is able to take ownership of projects by defining problems, brainstorming solutions, and running experiments.",3.2,"Triplebyte

705,Data Scientist (Natural Language Processing),-1,"Create the model that transforms the mortgage industry


Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction requires our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.

In an uncertain real estate market, lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they're used to in terms of speed and value in title and escrow.

Our streamlined algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company in early 2019 to go from startup to #8 in the country. With a broader nationwide footprint and a huge data set for machine learning, we are poised to transform this industry. We will repurpose the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

We're growing our document parsing data science team


We're looking for someone who is fired up to automate the manual labor currently associated with ingesting, reviewing, and reconciling the dozens of types of documents that need comprehension during a real estate transaction. This means everything from using advanced optical character recognition techniques to parse scanned documents, to using natural language processing to check their validity and action them.

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at Oracle, PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

Do you have what it takes?
3-10 years of relevant experience in data science
Excitement about delivering industry-shaking document parsing algorithms using natural language processing (NLP)
Experience in document processing is a plus, but not required: we will consider all accomplished persons in any area of NLP
Strengths aligned with our needs
E.g. Can you explain how convolutional kernels or attention mechanisms work without making reference to computers?
E.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?
E.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?
E.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?
We want to help you do the best work of your life


We believe the most valuable investment we can make — and the greatest boost we can give your career — is an exceptional team of colleagues who are passionate about what we are doing.

We currently offer the following benefits and will continually evolve them with the goal of efficiently attracting, retaining, and leveraging the very highest quality talent.
Our passionate, capable team will always be our #1 benefit
We are proud of the team we have built so far, and we are excited about the team we have yet to add

We empower our customers – farmers - to implement more sustainable solutions: optimize chemical usage, reimagining routine processes, and improving farming yields year after year. We believe that focusing on the small stuff – pixel-by-pixel and plant-by-plant - leads to big gains. By partnering with John Deere, we are innovating computer vision, machine learning, robotics and product management to solve monumental challenges for our customers.

Our people are at the heart of what we do. Through cross-discipline collaboration, this mission-driven and daring team is eager to define the new frontier of agricultural robotics. We are always asking hard questions, rapidly iterating, and getting our boots in the field to figure it out. We won't give up until we've made a tangible and positive impact on agriculture.

We are based in Sunnyvale, CA - but we are not contained to an office or our lab - the farm and field are also our playground. We have adapted to this virtual world and aren't just surviving it, but thriving through it. We are proud of our deeply collaborative culture at Blue River. We are a people-first company, and everyone here makes a tangible difference. We are passionate about what we're creating and can promise you, if you join, that your voice and contributions will matter. Are you ready to embark on the greatest adventure of your career?

Position Description:

Labeled data is the lifeblood of any supervised learning system, and our job on the Data and Machine Learning Platform team is to keep the supply of labeled data flowing as we scale our products. The cross-disciplinary nature of image annotation means that you will constantly be looking for creative solutions at the intersection of human-computer-interaction, machine learning, and software engineering.

As an ML engineer on the Platform team, you will work with data scientists, roboticists, and software engineers to discover and implement new ways to make our data usage more efficient. This includes labeling cost reduction and better data selection methods. You will investigate each part of the labeling process to find its bottlenecks: this ranges from reducing human labor by finding state-of-the-art computational techniques to the ergonomics of the labeling process and graphical user interface. To do this, you will need to be as technically savvy as you are empathetic with the human driven annotation process. You will build tools to help you rapidly experiment and capture data; where applicable, you will also experiment and develop annotation specific models as well.

Requirements:
Strong Python programmer
3+ years experience in data science software ecosystem: Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy
Experience with image processing libraries: OpenCV, PIL
Experiences with computer vision: e.g., color correction, image registration

(Glassdoor Est.)","ENERGY INDUSTRY TRANSFORMATION

The trillion dollar energy industry is undergoing a disruptive transformation. Energy generation is going from centralized to decentralized. Utilities are shifting from vertically integrated power producers and distributors (think PG&E; SoCal Edison) to nimbler energy services providers operating in increasingly deregulated environments. New generation assets are smaller in scale, distributed, powered through renewable sources, and owned by the customers. This shift will lead to over $10 Trillion in new energy investments by 2040. With this dramatic change, energy providers must run their business in new ways. Energy providers of the future will be data-driven, where effective use of data will determine who wins and who loses.

Enter AutoGrid

To make that data easier to generate, store and query we're building a next-generation analytics framework that will power all Revenue data and eventually do the same for Twitter broadly. We seek to make answering questions at Twitter as easy as asking them. Our team is pioneering new technologies at Twitter and was the first to run production services in Google Cloud. By using cloud technologies to solve problems we've learned that we can offload pager and infrastructure maintenance to Google and focus all of our time on solving the large problems that Twitter faces. Given the enormity of the task we face, we need your help to design and implement the tools and services that will make it easy for Twitter to make data-driven decisions.

If you have a philosophy of building the tools that solve a broad set of problems, this is the team for you. If you have a relentless customer focus that will help us to accelerate developer and analytic productivity, this is the team for you.

Job Description

What You'll Do:

Rather than speak in generalities, here is a sampling of what we've been building:
Large Data Collider (LDC) - Analytics query server with a pluggable backend that gives customers a consistent query interface. By providing consistency at query time, we can swap out backends like Bigtable and Druid to meet the latency or data model requirements of customers.
Big Executor - BigQuery and DataFlow Job executor that lets users define their data flows using SQL, opening up data pipeline creation to non-engineers.
SuperConductor - General Purpose data loading system that loads well-defined data into pluggable backends for querying by LDC. Supports streaming and batch inserts as well as streaming data compression.
Automatic Alerting - Will allow users to select the metrics that are important to them and uses models to highlight data outliers so users will be notified of any unexpected product behavior early.
Current/Upcoming projects:

Twitter has broadly recognized the platform as where the company as a whole wants to go for data analytics. To that end, we need you to help us expand the platform to serve an even broader set of use cases.
Data Aggregator - Beam based, configuration driven aggregator that lets users define their Aggregations and dimensions that can run against batch and streaming data sets. Allows users to define their aggregations without redeployment.
LDC Views - Build the ability to define custom views on the queries. Will allow users to define business logic and ensure consistent views on data regardless of backend.
What Else You Can Expect:

We believe that people are our strongest asset, and take special interest in each and every one of our engineers. You can expect a real investment in your professional growth, and a dedication to crafting a strong, sustainable career for you. Our teams are composed of highly talented and passionate 'A' players, and you'll get the mentorship and coaching you deserve to hone your skills and expertise. Our vibrant culture and high expectations will kindle your passion and bring out the best in you!

In particular, we are an experienced team of senior engineers that work across batch, streaming, and serving systems to deliver solutions to a diverse set of problems here at Twitter. We move quickly and we expect to make an impact. If this describes your approach to writing software, apply to join us!

845,Data Scientist (Natural Language Processing),-1,"Create the model that transforms the mortgage industry


Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction requires our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.

In an uncertain real estate market, lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they're used to in terms of speed and value in title and escrow.

Our streamlined algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company in early 2019 to go from startup to #8 in the country. With a broader nationwide footprint and a huge data set for machine learning, we are poised to transform this industry. We will repurpose the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

We're growing our document parsing data science team


We're looking for someone who is fired up to automate the manual labor currently associated with ingesting, reviewing, and reconciling the dozens of types of documents that need comprehension during a real estate transaction. This means everything from using advanced optical character recognition techniques to parse scanned documents, to using natural language processing to check their validity and action them.

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at Oracle, PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

Do you have what it takes?
3-10 years of relevant experience in data science
Excitement about delivering industry-shaking document parsing algorithms using natural language processing (NLP)
Experience in document processing is a plus, but not required: we will consider all accomplished persons in any area of NLP
Strengths aligned with our needs
E.g. Can you explain how convolutional kernels or attention mechanisms work without making reference to computers?
E.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?
E.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?
E.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?
We want to help you do the best work of your life


We believe the most valuable investment we can make — and the greatest boost we can give your career — is an exceptional team of colleagues who are passionate about what we are doing.

We currently offer the following benefits and will continually evolve them with the goal of efficiently attracting, retaining, and leveraging the very highest quality talent.

About Us: At Emendata, we help bridge the gap between data and the real world. We partner with organizations that have a social mission and help them tackle their problems using analytics. Our role in these partnerships goes end to end—we handle everything from wrangling the data to analyzing the problem to turning the results into something actionable. Importantly, we understand that this analytics pipeline does not live in a vacuum. Getting to meaningful numbers requires more than just the right methods; it calls for understanding the people, policies, data, and systems involved. With this approach, our small but fast-growing team is having a big impact, taking on challenges like using analytics to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare.
About the Role: This role leads the way in producing analytics that reflect a deep level of understanding and a high degree of quality. We are looking for you to:
Take analyses from end to end: Understand the client’s problem, identify the right research question, plan the methodology, corral the data, code the analysis, interpret the results, craft the deliverable, and communicate the story
Apply a research mentality: Use all tools at our disposal (documentation, policy regulations, data investigations, etc.) to make sound analytic decisions
Help the team deliver its best work: Turn direction from clients/senior staff into tactical plans and work closely with data analysts to help them implement (conducting code reviews, teaching/reinforcing analytic strategies, etc.)
This role will be a good fit for people who naturally push towards progress and are undeterred when that requires a lot of effort or stepping into unfamiliar territory. Emendata is growing rapidly, and we are looking for people who are excited to march forward together.
Qualifications: If you do not meet all the criteria below but still think you would be a good fit for this role, please apply so we can see if we can find the right spot for you on the team. We value experience but also welcome aptitude and enthusiasm.
Education: Bachelor’s or master’s degree in a quantitative field or equivalent technical training
Programming: Experience with SAS is a must (comfortable with SAS macro language, advanced DATA step techniques such as hashes, and PROC SQL); experience with Python, Stata, R, or SQL is a plus
Technical Mentorship: Demonstrated experience with reviewing code and providing feedback
Data Management: Comfortable with the process of importing, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis in a reproducible way
Analysis: Exceptional problem-solving skills with a good understanding of statistical/social science research methods; 4+ years hands-on experience in an analytics role (e.g., economic consulting)
Working Style: Intellectually curious (keep pulling on threads until finding an answer), enterprising (eager to tackle the unknown and find a way to make things happen), and collaborative (work with others to explore, build, tear down, and build again)
To be considered for this position, applicants must have the ability to work in the U.S. without a need for current or future visa sponsorship.
About the Interview Process: We want both sides to learn what it would be like to work together.
