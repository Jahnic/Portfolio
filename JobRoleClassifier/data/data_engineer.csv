Who are we?

We’re FarApp, a rapidly growing e-commerce automation solution company. It sounds like a lot of buzz words, but we really are growing fast and want to bring in new talented folks to help manage our rapidly expanding customer base. We hope that we can find that talent in you!

FarApp is a SAAS company who has been in business for over 15 years. In those 15 years, we’ve expanded our original codebase to over 1.5 million lines of code processing millions of operations a day. We connect to over 60 endpoints to help our customers become versatile e-commerce participants.

What will you be doing?

You’ll be diving into our code and figuring out ways to permanently solve problems that our customers either create or point out. This requires that you have a comfort with reading code in the context of a larger system without fear and that you're willing to try out and test solutions. You need to be comfortable deploying code 10 times a day into a live environment as you solve real-world problems.

You’ll also be helping to expand our product line. We add new endpoints to our service all the time, meaning that we must develop new connectors to integrate within our current system. That could mean something simple like a new logistics company, or it could be a new marketplace that has popped up that people are flocking to.

You’ll also be participating in our continuing effort to reduce our integration time. Currently, we have an average integration time for new customers of 40 days. We strongly believe we can reduce that to less than a day, maybe less than a couple of hours. We need your creative, intelligent ideas and initiative to make that happen.

We're looking for somebody who is passionate about software and is interested to start at the ground level with a company so that they can help it grow and share in its success. We hope that you're excited to make a big impact because you'll have plenty of opportunities to do that. We don't need somebody with a lot of experience but just need somebody who can learn new technologies quickly and is excited to make learning part of their regular routine.

Cool things:

Competitive salary with great benefits

Working from home! We’re evil and make you work from home two days a week!

We offer health, dental and vision plans.

We have a 401k plan.

Bi-monthly catered lunches and office snacks.

Bi-annual raises and performance-based bonuses.

Monthly company outings

Things you need (requirements):
BS Degree in Computer Science or related field
Knowledge in Python, Flask, TurboGears, AngularJS is a plus
Experience with eCommerce marketplaces and/or platforms and APIs is a plus
We're recruiting for applicants at levels of experience who are passionate about solving problems.

Every year, while Americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don't accept that.

Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we're working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.

Earnin is supported by funding partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Venture, Thrive Capital, and others. Join us and help build a new financial system focused on fairness and people's needs.

You can help make a difference.

We build magical products to delight our customers, and we do it while taking care of each other. We hire people who are outstanding at what they do, who thrive in tight-knit teams, and who want to make things that make a difference.

Together, we've built a product we're incredibly proud of, and the reward has been incredible growth.We work together because we believe in the power of creativity. We believe we can bring about a future where anyone can print anything.

We'd love to have you join us.

This is a full-time role in Santa Barbara, and we are happy to help new employees relocate to this paradise.

Why We Need You


One of the unusual things about the Glowforge architecture is that we moved many of the hard engineering problems from hardware to software and the software from device to the cloud. This means that our cloud service does the heavy lifting for features like alignment and autofocus, making what was once a tedious and error-prone process, fabulous and simple to use. It also makes it dead easy to diagram, draw, or doodle your invention and print it directly to wood, acrylic, fabric, leather, or paper. That software generates a tremendous amount of data that we use to create, improve, and polish new product experiences for our customers.

Our company succeeds only through insight and vision. Our data is precious, but it’s worthless without you. You create the tools that allow us to see.

Here’s what you’ll be doing


You will build products that are immediately deployed to help our company better understand and serve our customers and are used to radically improve the performance of our products! That is what this team of diverse, innovative, forward-thinking developers do as they create solid and effective data pipelining, warehousing, and analytical tools.

You will work with our internal tools & data team, analyzing and developing the different data needs; having a deep impact in the way we operate our data infrastructure and data workflows. You will have a tremendous influence on the everyday productivity of other teams, as the tools and processes you will work on will profoundly improve their effectiveness.

You will partner with people across the organization to understand business needs and deploy strategic solutions to address those needs.

You need these qualifications
You understand how data can impact every aspect of a business and are familiar with different architectures and approaches that are used to collect, transform, analyze, and synthesize data.
You have an infectious passion for data which is proven in the tools you've built and the way you help others understand the power of data.
You have a 4 year degree or equivalent experience and at least 2 years industry experience
It would be nice if...
You’re a passionate builder, crafter, or maker.
You’ve worked in and/or understand the challenges of a start-up.
You care deeply about customer experience and ease of use.
You are skilled in modern web technologies, including Node.js, React, and Ruby/Rails.

Every year, while Americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don't accept that.

At Pngme, we are building a data platform to change the way individuals, entrepreneurs, and businesses access finance in sub-Saharan Africa. Financial institutions use our data to make mission critical decisions that drive access to finance in sub-Saharan Africa. While capital is plentiful, it does not flow equally. Why? Without access to the right data, financial institutions cannot properly measure risk or develop financial products tailored to their customers! Africa is the fastest growing developer ecosystem in the world, but there is still a high barrier to entry for developers to access holistic financial data on their customers. It is Pngme’s mission to democratize developers’ access to data and close the finance gap for millions of individuals, entrepreneurs, and businesses in sub-Saharan Africa.

We see value in providing equal access to capital so people can increase their wealth and opportunity, despite their limited resources. By providing access to data, we enable financial institutions to comfortably deploy their capital and make data-driven decisions to drive the growth of their business. It isn’t just access to data, it’s also a matter of putting data ownership back into the hands of people. With equal access and ownership of data, we give people financial choice and freedom.

We are growing our tribe and looking for a diverse slate of individuals to help us democratize access to the financial data that reduces perceived risk in Africa and beyond. We love our product, but we love our people more, recognizing that without them, none of this would be possible. We know there is so much talent out there, with so much to offer, but who feel lost or unappreciated in their current position. We want to invite those folks to join Pngme.

What It's Like to Work at Fictiv


We're a small, close-knit team with a core group in San Francisco and a few remote engineers around the country. While all engineers need protected time to get things done, we also believe collaboration and creative tension create the best product. That's why we encourage a rhythm of heads down, independent work followed by focused constructive debate.

Product development teams follow the principles from the Scrum Guide. We're practical about process (we use what works), but we've found Scrum ceremonies to be a positive framework for transparency and collaboration. To save time, we keep Sprint Plannings to 1 hour and Sprint Reviews to 45 minutes for our two-week sprints.

Since we are a small team, all engineers (including managers) are on-call for two weeks out of every 8-10 weeks. This builds team cohesion and deepens our understanding of our production system. We are all here to support one another, so if you have personal events during this time we're happy to swap slots or cover for you.

We're constantly evolving our practices, so please feel free to ask questions and share your thoughts as well!

Problem

In the $12T construction industry, 98% of projects are delivered, on average, 80% over budget. Doxel is on a mission to stop that from happening.

Root cause? Inability to measure site progress in an objective, trustworthy and frequent manner. Construction managers are frequently surprised to discover that their multi-million dollar projects have been running behind for several weeks or months. By that point, the money has already been spent and it s too late to fix the problem.

Solution

Doxel uses robots to survey sites every day, proprietary deep learning and AI based algorithms to assess progress and turns the terabytes of data it collects into simple insights for project managers that enable them to react to issues in minutes, not months. This enables them to constantly correct site inefficiencies and has demonstrated ROI by eliminating overages and even delivering projects up to 11% below budget.

Doxel has taken the market by storm since its launch last year - closing deals with marquee customers such as Kaiser Permanente, Sutter Health, and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.

You must educate teams, build a consensus, and deliver solutions that will work across the company. This includes contributing to the system design of our apps to ensure the operations to build and deploy that app are automation-friendly and scalable.

REDWOOD CITY, CA / OPERATIONS & ENGINEERING / FULL TIME

Problem

In the $12T construction industry, 98% of projects are delivered, on average, 80% over budget. Doxel is on a mission to stop that from happening.

Root cause? Inability to measure site progress in an objective, trustworthy and frequent manner. Construction managers are frequently surprised to discover that their multi-million dollar projects have been running behind for several weeks or months. By that point, the money has already been spent and it s too late to fix the problem.

Solution

Doxel uses robots to survey sites every day, proprietary deep learning and AI based algorithms to assess progress and turns the terabytes of data it collects into simple insights for project managers that enable them to react to issues in minutes, not months. This enables them to constantly correct site inefficiencies and has demonstrated ROI by eliminating overages and even delivering projects up to 11% below budget.

Doxel has taken the market by storm since its launch last year - closing deals with marquee customers such as Kaiser Permanente, Sutter Health, and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.

Team

Doxel s team consists of some of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley that include PhDs, engineers, business leaders and civil engineering professionals on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, graduates from Stanford University and with experience at organizations such as Google Advanced Technologies & Projects.

The secondary role is to work with the Doxel Product and Engineering groups to develop utilities for improving model organization efficiencies and tracking tools.

This will involve:
Analyze Project Schedules
Analyze Cost Data in Work Breakdown Structures (WBS)
Organize 3D Models with Schedule and Cost Data
Work Closely with Product and Engineering Teams for Project Deliverables
As a BIM Data Engineer at Doxel, you will have a clear understanding of the Project Schedules and Design Models used for the Doxel analytics engine. This includes familiarization with design detailing software and scheduling platforms used in the construction industry. You will maintain constant communication with the Doxel BIM Manager, Product Manager, and other Doxel Team members. You will support all aspects of the Doxel data pipeline and achieve high levels of accuracy in data organization.

Working at Doxel keeps you at the leading edge of the latest 3D Scanning Technology while working with some of the brightest minds in this new industry. Our established team of Data Engineers look forward to adding an enthusiastic mind with a proactive attitude into their world of achieving a never before realized level of construction efficiency.

We Are Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Cisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis.

Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

We Are Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

We Are Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.
