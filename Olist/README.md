![logo](logo.jfif)

**Definition of business case**

According to statista.com, Brazil is the largest and fastest growing e-commerce market in Latin America. Contrary to most countries, Brazils online market is shared by multiple large companies, which entails unique challenges for retailers interested in e-commerce. Potential sellers cannot rely on a single platform, such as Amazon, to adequately distribute their product.  

Olist is a young startup, established in 2015, that connects small local retailers to available e-commerce marketplaces. Orders placed on Olists platform are forwarded to the corresponding retailer which is responsible for issuing an invoice and printing a shipping label. Everything else, such as product marketing and delivery, is handled by Olist in partnership with other companies. Revenue is primarily generated through registered retailers by collecting a 20% markup from each sale as well as monthly fees of $50 (labs.ebanx.com).  

The company has raised over 55M USD in funding and hired more than 200 employees since its inception (LinkedIn.com). For the future, Olist is focused on increasing revenue by growing the number of retailers actively using their platform. By the end of 2021, the network aims to employ over 100,000 small retailers (labs.ebanx.com).

**Choice of dataset**

Data from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) was used to gain insight into Olists current network. Potential avenues to drive user and seller growth are examined. The data set contains 9 csv files organized in a relational schema. Files contain information about customers, sellers, geolocations, items, payments, reviews, placed orders and a translation of product categories from Portuguese to English. Total data volume amounts to 140MB.

**Value proposition**

Olist is focused on increasing the number of sellers using their platform. Retailers, on the other hand, are interested in maximizing their online sales to compensate for the 20% markup and recurring monthly fees. However, the more sellers, the higher the competition and the lower the turnover for individual retailers. Consequently, if the objective is to grow the seller base, it will be vital to optimize product marketing to reach as many potential buyers as possible.
