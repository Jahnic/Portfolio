# Analysis of Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce service provider

**Definition of business case**

According to statista.com, Brazil is the largest and fastest growing e-commerce market in Latin America. Contrary to most countries, Brazils online market is shared by multiple large companies, which entails unique challenges for retailers interested in e-commerce. Potential sellers cannot rely on a single platform, such as Amazon, to adequately distribute their product.  

Olist is a young startup, established in 2015, that connects small local retailers to available e-commerce marketplaces. Orders placed on Olists platform are forwarded to the corresponding retailer which is responsible for issuing an invoice and printing a shipping label. Everything else, such as product marketing and delivery, is handled by Olist in partnership with other companies. Revenue is primarily generated through registered retailers by collecting a 20% markup from each sale as well as monthly fees of $50 (labs.ebanx.com).  

The company has raised over 55M USD in funding and hired more than 200 employees since its inception (LinkedIn.com). For the future, Olist is focused on increasing revenue by growing the number of retailers actively using their platform. By the end of 2021, the network aims to employ over 100,000 small retailers (labs.ebanx.com).

**Choice of dataset**

Data from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) was used to gain insight into Olists current network. Potential avenues to drive user and seller growth are examined. The data set contains 9 csv files organized in a relational schema. Files contain information about customers, sellers, geolocations, items, payments, reviews, placed orders and a translation of product categories from Portuguese to English. Total data volume amounts to 140MB.

**Purpose of project**

This project explores strategies to increase value for Olist.  
A rudimentary exploration of the data is implemented.

**Results**

Data on orders placed through Olist was retrieved over a period of two years from 2016 to 2018. The data contains 99441 records of orders from 96096 unique customers. This implies that most customers have placed only a single order during the entire period of data collection. For the assembly of the dataset datapoints were probably chosen at random. Consequently, customer aggregations would not be meaningful. 

Questions about the data have been defined to guide the analysis. Areas for further inquiry have been identified such as product delivery, geographical seller distributions and one-/two-stars customer reviews. Top categories have been visualized, which has revealed a high demand for furniture and homeware related products.
